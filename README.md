<h2>UTM Digital Open Day Experience</h2>

<p>
On <strong>28 October 2025</strong>, I had the opportunity to join the
<strong>UTM Digital Open Day</strong> held at <strong>UTM Digital (D07)</strong>,
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor Bahru. The event was designed to expose
students to UTM’s digital initiatives, enterprise systems, and technology-driven
solutions used to support the university’s operations.
</p>

<p>
One of the highlights of the event was a knowledge-sharing session on
<strong>Oracle technologies</strong> delivered by
<strong>Encik Muhammad Asrul Muhammad Zain</strong>. During the session, he explained
the fundamentals of Oracle systems, their applications in managing large-scale
data and enterprise environments, and their importance in today’s digital industry.
He also shared valuable insights into the <strong>academic pathways</strong> related to
this field, as well as potential <strong>career opportunities</strong> for students who
are interested in pursuing a future in enterprise technology and database systems.
</p>

<p>
Besides attending the talk, we were given the opportunity to explore several
<strong>exhibition booths</strong> showcasing different digital services and systems
developed or managed by UTM Digital. These booths provided a clearer understanding
of how technology is implemented to improve efficiency, accessibility, and user
experience within the university environment.
</p>

<p>
We also conducted an interview with one of the <strong>UTM Digital staff members</strong>,
which allowed us to gain deeper insights into the <strong>UTMSmart platform</strong>.
Through this interaction, we learned how UTMSmart operates as a smart campus
solution, integrating various digital features to support students and staff.
We were introduced to several <strong>new and upcoming features</strong> that demonstrate
UTM’s commitment to continuous digital innovation and smart campus development.
</p>

<p>
Overall, participating in the UTM Digital Open Day was a highly
<strong>informative, engaging, and enriching experience</strong>. The event not only
enhanced my understanding of enterprise systems such as Oracle, but also provided
valuable exposure to real-world digital applications used in a large institution.
This experience has further strengthened my interest in technology and motivated
me to explore more opportunities related to digital systems and information
technology in the future.
