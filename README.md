<h2>UTM Digital Open Day Experience</h2>

<p>
On <strong>28 October 2025</strong>, I had the opportunity to participate in the
<strong>UTM Digital Open Day</strong> held at <strong>UTM Digital (D07)</strong>,
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru.
</p>

<p>
During the event, I gained valuable insights into <strong>Oracle technologies</strong>,
presented by <strong>Encik Muhammad Asrul Muhammad Zain</strong>. His session highlighted
Oracle’s role in the industry and explained the <strong>academic and career pathways</strong>
available in this field, broadening my understanding of future career opportunities.
</p>

<p>
In addition, we visited several exhibition booths and interviewed one of the
<strong>UTM Digital staff members</strong>. Through this interaction, I learned more about
<strong>UTMSmart</strong>, how it functions, and explored some of its
<strong>latest and innovative features</strong> that support UTM’s digital ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the UTM Digital Open Day was an <strong>informative and engaging experience</strong>
that enhanced my exposure to digital systems, enterprise technologies, and real-world
applications within a university environment.
