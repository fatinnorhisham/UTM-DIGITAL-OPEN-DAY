On **28 October 2025**, I had the opportunity to join the
UTM Digital Open Day held at UTM Digital (D07),
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor Bahru. The event was designed to expose
students to UTM’s digital initiatives, enterprise systems, and technology-driven
solutions used to support the university’s operations.



One of the highlights of the event was a knowledge-sharing session on
Oracle technologies delivered by
Encik Muhammad Asrul Muhammad Zain. During the session, he explained
the fundamentals of Oracle systems, their applications in managing large-scale
data and enterprise environments, and their importance in today’s digital industry.
He also shared valuable insights into the academic pathways related to
this field, as well as potential career opportunities for students who
are interested in pursuing a future in enterprise technology and database systems.



Besides attending the talk, we were given the opportunity to explore several
exhibition booths showcasing different digital services and systems
developed or managed by UTM Digital. These booths provided a clearer understanding
of how technology is implemented to improve efficiency, accessibility, and user
experience within the university environment.



We also conducted an interview with one of the UTM Digital staff members,
which allowed us to gain deeper insights into the UTMSmart platform.
Through this interaction, we learned how UTMSmart operates as a smart campus
solution, integrating various digital features to support students and staff.
We were introduced to several new and upcoming features that demonstrate
UTM’s commitment to continuous digital innovation and smart campus development.



Overall, participating in the UTM Digital Open Day was a highly
informative, engaging, and enriching experience. The event not only
enhanced my understanding of enterprise systems such as Oracle, but also provided
valuable exposure to real-world digital applications used in a large institution.
This experience has further strengthened my interest in technology and motivated
me to explore more opportunities related to digital systems and information
technology in the future.
